# Custom Shell (C++ Linux Shell)

A custom Unix-like command shell written in **C++**, featuring:

- Command parsing and execution
- Pipelines (`|`)
- Input/Output redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`)
- Background execution (`&`)
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `exit`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`
- Basic job control with process groups and signals
- Colorized, informative prompt

This project is designed for systems programming and DevOps learning and is fully containerized to run anywhere.
